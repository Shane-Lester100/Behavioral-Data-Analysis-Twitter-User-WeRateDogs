# Behavioral Data Analysis: Twitter User WeRateDogs

By using likes and retweets as a metric to measure popularity, and by analyzing patterns in textual data, we can better understand the appeal between tweets of a famous Twitter account. In this case, we analyze the comedy account WeRateDogs. Insight can inform users in their behavior or on posters on how to make more popular posts.

Insight occurs by observing the behavioral patterns of users and in the habits of the poster, and how they converge to make popular posts. This analysis uncovers trends in textual data and popularity benchmarks by using visualizations, summary statistics, finding correlations, and building linear models. Data stories occur through data visualizations involving word clouds and sentiment analysis provided by the natural language processing library TextBlob.
